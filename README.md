# AI_learning_how_to_drive
Browser-based self-driving car simulation using neuroevolution. Built with p5.js and TensorFlow.js, cars evolve neural network weights through a genetic algorithm—no labeled data required. Across generations, they learn to follow tracks, avoid walls, and reach the finish line entirely through selection and mutation.
